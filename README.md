# Formalization of Ethereum Virtual Machine in Lem

This repository contains

* (EI) an EVM implementation in Lem `lem/evm.lem`
* (EI) a Keccak-256 implementation in Lem `lem/keccak.lem`
* (EI) a form of functional correctness defined in Lem `lem/evmNonExec.lem`
* (EI) a relational semantics that captures the environment's nondeterministic behavior `RelationalSem.thy`
* (EI) some example verified contracts in `example`
* (EI) a parser that parses hex code and emits an Isabelle/HOL expression representing the program `parser/hexparser.rb`
* Elle, a work-in-progress verified compiler from a structured language to EVM in `elle`

Items marked (EI) are part of the original [eth-isabelle](https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle) distribution.

When you see `\<Rightarrow>` in the source, try using the [Isabelle2017](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/index.html) interface.  There you see `â‡’` instead.

## Elle

This fork of eth-isabelle contains Elle, a compiler targeting EVM implemented in Isabelle that aims to be foundationally verified somewhat along the lines of [CompCert](http://compcert.inria.fr/)

## Building the LLLLC Standalone Executable

To build Elle's LLL compiler (llllc), only OCaml is needed (tested on version 4.02.3).

`cd elle/generated`

`make`

This should produce an executable, `llllc`.

To check the proofs of Elle and regenerate the file `elle/generated/FourL.ml`, which serves
as the source file used to build the OCaml standalone version of Elle, run

`make cleanGenerated`

and then check the file `elle/FourLExtract.thy` using the Isabelle IDE. If you don't
have Isabelle and Lem installed, you won't be able to regenerate `elle/generated/FourL.ml`, so be careful.

(adding support for a command-line build of `elle/generated/FourL.ml` is a TODO)

For more info on how to do this (which requires installing Lem and Isabelle),
see [the Eth-Isabelle README](./README_EthIsabelle.md).

## Testing the Elle Standalone Executable

Elle's llllc aims to be compatible in terms of inputs and outputs with the lll compiler
included in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity). To test out the compiler,
once you have built the `llllc` executable:

`cd elle/tests`

`../generated/llllc echo.lll`

(or any other lll file in the directory)

Currently the major limitations of Elle are the following (resolving both are TODOs):

- Only supports a single payload returned by `returnlll`; furthermore, it will ignore all
constructor code that takes place after the first `returnlll`.

- Does not yet support lll's `lit` construct for embedding literals in a program.

- Core compiler verification proofs are incomplete; this should be considered an unverified
version of Elle.

### Elle Syntax

`elle/ElleSyntax.thy`

### Elle Semantics

`elle/ElleSemantics.thy`

### Elle Compiler

`elle/ElleCompiler.thy`

### Compiler Correctness

### Roadmap

### Warning

### Legacy Version

A previous version of the compiler exists in `examples/LLLL.thy`. It contains a number of lemmas that have ended up
being unnecessary so far but may prove useful or educational.
